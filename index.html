          <h2>How does gender influence mode choice?</h2>
          <p>There are many socio-economic factors which influence selection of mode for travel. In Australia, research has shown
             that <span>women</span> are generally under-represented when it comes to cycling. This is in stark contrast to other European 
             cities, such as Netherlands, where cycling rates amongst <span>women are are much higher.</span></p>
          <p>The stacked bar chart below shows this general trend clearly. Hover over the bar chart or click on the legend labels to distinguish
            between males and <span>females</span>. Note that the 'unspecified' category represents those in the VISTA survey who did not wish to 
            disclose their gender.

          <h2>How does household size affect travel behaviour?</h2>
          <p>Research has shown that Household Size (HH Size, which represents the number of persons in a household) directly correlates with the number of trips generated. 
            That is, larger households create more trips than smaller households. The choropleth map below shows that areas
            closer to Melbourne CBD tend to have smaller sized households (on average), while those in outer suburban or rural areas have larger
            household sizes (on average).</p>
          <p>Under the research showing this correlation, it can be seen that <span>households further away from 
            CBD region make more trips per household </span>. Note that Statistical Area (SA2 Region) are official regions used by the Australian
          Bureau of Statistics in the census. The represent geographic regions of consistent economic and social standings.</p>

          <h2>Trip characteristics and purposes</h2>
          <p>People make trips for different reasons, such as for work, shopping or socialising. The bubble chart below
            shows that work related trips can vary significantly in duration and distance. Shopping trips generally tend to be much 
            shorter, implying that people prefer to shop locally. We can also see when the trip duration gets longer, so does the wait time. 
            Trip duration and distance are strongly related, however, the former increases at a much faster rate than the latter.
          </p>
          <p>Please toggle between different trip purposes by selecting the legend. Longer trips can be filtered by using the wait time slider. Further, 
            the drop down selection can be used to filter for a selection of Local Government Areas (LGAs).

          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p>From our analysis, we can see that greater focus should be invested in promoting active transportation modes as the private motor vehicle is 
            most popular choice of travel mode. This is also important to ensure that riding feels safe, as generally many women in Australia (and Western Countries)
          are reluctant to ride, compared to European countries. We have also seen that regions closer to the CBD tend to travel less than those further away. Greater focus
        should be on intensifying land uses closer to CBD areas. Overall, these strategies can help improve the sustainability of transport in Melbourne. </p>
